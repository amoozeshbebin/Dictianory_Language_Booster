In this application, there are a number of texts with English to Farsi meanings, which the user can add to the favorites, and with this, the ticked star will enter the database, and the user can also have his own dictionary! That is, through the floatin Action Button, you can create a text with the desired meaning with your own language, which is a great feature of the program.
This program is made 100% with Kotlin and xml files and also uses the good functionality of orm for storage in the database.
This program's layout is in the form of neomorphism and has a very beautiful and pleasant design
